I've developed multiple computational pipelines for untargeted mass spectrometry data processing across domains such as metabolomics, lipidomics, exposomics, and environmental studies. My development philosophy emphasizes maximal automation, high precision, multi-platform compatibility, and user-friendly interfaces to minimize extensive lab-based experiments. I’m also driven to advance next-generation AI for chemistry and biological applications.

## Developing AI-Powered Digital Twins Replica for Bioreactors at [Aropha](https://github.com/Aropha)
At Aropha, I lead the development of digital twins for bioreactors—high-fidelity virtual replicas that enable accurate performance prediction, real-time process monitoring, and data-driven decision-making in dynamic bioproduction workflows. By integrating state-of-the-art AI with bioprocess engineering, our approach enhances process control, reduces experimental costs, and accelerates optimization.

## Completed Projects

### Mass Spectrometry Data Processing Workflows
At the [Integrated Data Science Laboratory for Metabolomics and Exposomics](https://github.com/idslme), I developed an end-to-end untargeted metabolomics workflow to efficiently process and annotate large-scale mass spectrometry data. This workflow minimizes reliance on purely data-driven methods by leveraging stable isotopic principles that underpin biochemistry and organic chemistry.

### Environmental Cheminformatics and PhD Research Projects
During my doctoral research, I developed computational mass spectrometry pipelines for environmental cheminformatics projects.

- **Isotopic Profile Deconvoluted Chromatogram (IPDC):**  
  An algorithm designed to screen complex environmental matrices for unknown contaminants using chemometric methods. The IPDC algorithm was successfully applied in five projects during my PhD.
