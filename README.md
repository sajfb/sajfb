I'm an award-winning data scientist bridging cheminformatics and metabolomics focusing on small molecule discovery and mass spectrometry data sciences (see my [award news](https://mountsinaiexposomics.org/dr-sadjad-fakouri-baygi-wins-the-mark-p-styczynski-early-career-award-in-computational-metabolomics-from-metabolomics-association-of-north-america-mana/) from Metabolomics Association of North America (MANA) and my presentation details [here](https://metabolomicscentre.ca/metabonews-november-issue-mana-conference-presenters)).

I've crafted multiple computational pipelines designed for untargeted mass spectrometry data processing across diverse research domains including metabolomics, lipidomics, exposomics, and environmental studies. My software development philosophy emphasizes on maximal automation, highest precision, multi-platform compatibility, and user-friendly interfaces to minimize lab-based experiments.

I am always driven to advance next-generation AI for chemistry and biological applications.

## Developing AI-Powered Digital Twins for Bioreactors at [Aropha](https://github.com/Aropha)
At Aropha, I lead the development of digital twins for bioreactors. These high-fidelity virtual replicas enable accurate performance prediction, real-time process monitoring, and data-driven decision-making in prolonged and dynamic bioproduction workflows. By integrating state-of-the-art AI with core bioprocess engineering principles, our approach enhances process control, reduces experimental costs, and accelerates optimization. You can explore our [**digital twin platform**](https://modelserver.aropha.com) for batch processing simulations.

## Completed projects
#### Mass Spectrometry Data Processing Workflows at the [Integrated Data Science Laboratory for Metabolomics and Exposomics](https://github.com/idslme)

The tools shown in this diagram present a comprehensive, end-to-end untargeted metabolomics workflow designed to efficiently process and annotate large-scale mass spectrometry data. This workflow minimizes reliance on data-driven methods, instead leveraging stable isotopic principles that underpin all organic compounds across biochemistry and organic chemistry.

#### Computational mass spectrometry pipelines for environmental cheminformatics projects as part of my doctoral research
  - An [IPDC](https://github.com/sajfb/Isotopic-Profile-Deconvolution-Chromatogram-IPDC-algorithm) (Isotopic Profile Deconvoluted Chromatogram) algorithm to screen biologically complex environmental matrices for unknown contaminants using chemometric methods. The IPDC algorithm was successfully employed in five different projects during my PhD.
